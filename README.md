# Day Night Image Classifier

#### Problem Statement
Given an outdoor image classify whether it was captured in day or night with good level of confidence and accuracy.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for the project is a smaller version of the huge [AMOS dataset](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/datasets/amos/) *(Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes)*.

#### Aim
We'd like to build a classifier that can accurately label these images as day or night, and that relies on finding distinguishing features between the two types of images!
